# Java Basics and Structure

Editor: VS Code IDE: Type the code and do everything

### Main Method (Start of Execution)
```java
public static void main(String[] a)
```

### Java is Object-Oriented
- Everything should be an object.
- To create an object, we need a class.

Example:
```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] a) {
        
    }
}
```

### Notes
- The first file needs to have the main method (first execution file). It expects a specific signature.
- The main method is the start of execution.
